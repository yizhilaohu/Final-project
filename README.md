## Our Analysis
we have analysed the problems of three aspects.
- The first one is the trend of coming guests. We designed a calendar that allows users to select specific days to view. The number of days in the calendar is the same as the period covered by the dataset, which is from July 1, 2015 to August 31, 2017. Then there is a arrival number display according to the date of customer chose in the calendar. Also, there is a general table of arrival number and the charts of weekly and monthly arrival number data.

- The second analysis is about average daily rate. The average daily rate as defined by dividing the sum of all lodging transactions by the total number of staying nights. People can choose different options named box, hist and line to see different figures.
